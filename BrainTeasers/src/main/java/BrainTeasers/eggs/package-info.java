 *
 * The Two Egg Problem
 *
 *You are given two eggs, both eggs are identical and access to a 100-storey building. 
 *
 *
 * The aim is to find out the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped out of a 
 * window from that floor. If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped 
 *a gain. However, once an egg is broken, it cannot be used any longer.
 *
 * ps.  If an egg breaks when dropped from floor n, then it would also have broken from any floor above that. 
 * pss. If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that.
 *
 * The challange is: 
 *
 * What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the solution?. 
 * (And what is the worst case for the number of drops it will take?)
 *
 * Note: Before writing code to calulate you should figure out the math.
